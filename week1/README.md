## Carousel

Create an array that represents people hopping off a carousel.  The array will store the names of each person on the carousel.
Loop through the carousel using a for loop. Every other cycle through the loop (odd), someone will hop off.  
Print the name of the person who hops off.
Repeat until the carousel is empty.

## You are an object...

Create a dictionary (aka an object) that represents yourself.
Assign ten attributes about yourself to this object.
Use a loop to list all of these attributes (and the keys that they are associated with).  Print both the key and value of the object in a string like this, replacing the quoted values for each key and value pair appropriately: "'Your name' has 'key' of 'value'".

## Division for Elementary School

In elementary school, when you divide you typically use division and have to report the remainder.
Create a function that returns a string.
It will accept two arguments: a number, and a number to divide that number against.
The returned string should state what the result is and the remainder.
You will need to use the / and the % operators.
