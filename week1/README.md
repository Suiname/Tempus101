# Homework Assignment #1

Covering the concepts from the first few weeks of class, [video is available here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7OyO_NU1fc)
Clone a copy of the [Tempus101 github repository here.](https://github.com/Suiname/Tempus101)
In order to submit your homework, create a new git branch named "yourname_week1".  Inside the week1 directory in the Tempus101 repository, make another directory with your own name (e.g. Tempus101/week1/Jason), and place all your files in this directory.  When your homework is ready, create a Pull Request into the master branch from your branch.  Details on how to both create branches and make pull requests are explained in the last 10 or so minutes of the youtube video above.

## Carousel
Create a python (.py) file named carousel.py inside your folder.  Inside this file solve the following problem:
Create an array that represents people hopping off a carousel.  The array will store the names of each person on the carousel.
Loop through the carousel using a for loop. Every other cycle through the loop (odd), someone will hop off.  
Any time a person hops off, print the name of the person who hops off.  If no one is hopping off because it is an even cycle, print "still spinning..."
Repeat until the carousel is empty.

## You are an object...
Create a python (.py) file named object.py inside your folder.  Inside this file solve the following problem:
Create a dictionary (aka an object) that represents yourself.
Assign ten attributes about yourself to this object.
Use a loop to list all of these attributes (and the keys that they are associated with).  Print both the key and value of the object in a string like this, replacing the quoted values for each key and value pair appropriately: "'Your name' has 'key' of 'value'".

## Division for Elementary School
Create a python (.py) file named division.py inside your folder.  Inside this file solve the following problem:
In elementary school, when you divide you typically use division and have to report the remainder.
Create a function named "elementary_division" that returns a string.
It will accept two arguments: a number, and a number to divide that number against.
The returned string should state what the result is and the remainder, in a format like this "The result is 2 and the remainder is 4".
You will likely need to use the / and the % operators.
